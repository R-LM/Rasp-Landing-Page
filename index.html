                        <p>Rasp is a soda made of 2 main ingridients: <b><span class="red">Raspberry juice</span> <span class="green">and</span> <span class="brown">Coconut</span> <span class="grey">milk</span></b>. Combining the right amount of this 2 natural and fresh ingridients with carbonated water creates a remarkable taste.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="text-highlight">The Taste</p>
                        <p>The taste can be described as extremely refreshing, and with a unique and distinctive creamy flavor that, instead of saturating the drink, complements the freshness.</p>

                        <p class="text-highlight">It started as an experiment</p>
                        <p><b><span class="red">Raspberry</span> <span class="green">and</span> <span class="brown">coconut</span> <span class="grey">milk</span></b> smoothies are very delicious, but the team was trying to create something unique. They were trying to make a raspberry and coconut milk drink that was delicious but also fresh and thirst quenching.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="text-highlight">It was a challenge</p>
                        <p>The main difficulty was balancing the richness of the <b><span class="brown">coconut</span> <span class="grey">milk</span></b> with the acidic flavor of <b><span class="green">the</span> <span class="red">Raspberry</span></b> and try to make it refreshing at the same time.</p>
                        <p>This combination of flavor works incredibly in smoothies, but the team was aiming for a refreshing drink. The ingredients have to be mixed in the right amount, at the right time and in the right way.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="text-highlight">The team succeeded</p>
                        <p>The team was able to produce the result they wanted. The acidic flavor, the creaminess, that thirst quenching freshness, it was all there and it was delicious.</p>
                        <p>It was originally going to be sold as a non-carbonated soft drink, but, someone had the crazy idea to add fizziness to it.</p>
                        <p>The result was unbelievable.</p>
